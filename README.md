# dotfiles
My dotfiles used in Arch Linux environment.

After spending some time configuring neovim from ground zero and still having problems with plugins, I decided to go with [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org) and I'm liking it.

Also, after messing around with [Starship](https://starship.rs/) I discovered the [Powerlevel 10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), which is a lot simpler to configure. Unfortunatelly, it works only in Linux environments through zsh, so my powershell prompt will stay as default, or I'll mess a little bit with Starship later.

My intention is to add only Linux config files here, but take into consideration that I'm working on a WSL environment and it may require some change if you're on Linux native.

Here's how LunarVim looks like with my current setup:
